# Compile
You need to compile with a Visual Studio 2019 Compiler (CL)

1. To setup CL, run [`misc/shell.bat`](https://github.com/Grouter/game1/blob/master/misc/shell.bat). This will setup path variables in a current shell.
2. To compile run [`misc/build.bat`](https://github.com/Grouter/game1/blob/master/misc/build.bat).
3. The result .exe will be in a `build/` folder
